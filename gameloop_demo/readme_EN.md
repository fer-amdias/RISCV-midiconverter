# HOW DO I RUN THIS?

[Download FPGRARS](https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS/releases/tag/v1.13.1) (the 8-bit display version matching your operating system). Afterwards, ake sure the downloaded file and all the files in this folder are in the same directory. Then, run the downloaded file in the terminal (make sure to run it FROM the directory) with ./gameloop_EN.s as the argument. And... voil√†! It should run right off the bat. 

In case you're running FPGRARS for Linux, you may need to follow additional instructions [available here](https://leoriether.github.io/FPGRARS/midi/).
